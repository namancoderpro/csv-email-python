# csv-email-python
This program will allow you to send emails to a list of people in a CSV file automatically! The notes for the program are given inside the file. Some of the important ones are:
1. Make sure you use a CSV File
2. Make sure that your CSV has no headers, or else the program will display an error
3. Edit the index in the program according to where different details are situated in your CSV. For eg: If email of the receiver is in the first column, then the index shall be line[0]. The index starts at 0. 
4. Edit the program according to your needs

Hope you have a great time using it!
